JDK 1.7
Minecraft 1.8.8
Spigot version from the 27.05.1015

This Plugin detects all Plugins installed on your Spigot-Server, reads their config/plugin.yml and gives the player information about said Plugins when they join the server, including their name, author(s), commands used/ coded and descriptions (if included in the confic/plugin.yml).

The latest .jar file is included under Meta_af/out/artifacts.
Simply move said file to the Plugins folder of your Server and either restart or reload the Server.
